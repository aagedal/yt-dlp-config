# Just my personal yt-dlp-config

This is a config file for yt-dlp.

On macOS: place the "config" file in /Users/[YourUserNameHereWithoutBrackets]/.config/yt-dlp/ or, if you prefer that path syntax: ~/.config/yt-dlp/
Note that the path may not exist and that you may need to manually create it yourself.

- The config file reencodes all downloads to mp4. This is to maximize compatibility. This may only work properly if FFMPEG is also installed.
- The config file also makes sure that all files are downloaded to "~/Downloads/yt-dlp/"


This config file is tested on macOS Sonoma with yt-dlp and ffmpeg being installed via Homebrew.
